# Introduction

### Your every pull request is precious to us.

>First off, thank you for considering contributing to info.com. It's people like you that make info.com such a great tool.

### Guidelines are necessary to avoid spammy PRs.

>Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, you should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

### Contributions I am looking for.
Contribute if you have some additonal features,found some issue,can make UI better and anything else too.

> Info.com is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community — you! There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into info.com itself.

# Ground Rules
### Set expectations for behavior (yours, and theirs).
This includes not just how to communicate with others (being respectful, considerate, etc) but also technical responsibilities (importance of testing, project dependencies, etc).

> Responsibilities
> * Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change that's accepted. Windows, Mac, Debian & Ubuntu Linux.
> * Ensure that code that goes into core meets all requirements in this checklist: https://gist.github.com/audreyr/4feef90445b9680475f2
> * Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
> * Don't add any classes to the codebase unless absolutely needed. Err on the side of using functions.
> * Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
> * Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds. See the [Python Community Code of Conduct](https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/).

# Your First Contribution

> Unsure where to begin contributing to info.com? You can start by looking through these beginner and help-wanted issues:
> Beginner issues - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
> Help wanted issues - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues.
> Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.

# Getting started

>1. Create your own fork of the code
>2. Do the changes in your fork
>3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
    * Be sure you have followed the code style for the project.
    * Sign the Contributor License Agreement, CLA, with the jQuery Foundation.
    * Note the jQuery Foundation Code of Conduct.
    * Send a pull request indicating that you have a CLA on file.

### Small or "obvious" fixes

>* Spelling / grammar fixes
>* Typo correction, white space and formatting changes
>* Comment clean up
>* Bug fixes that change default return values or error codes stored in constants
>* Adding logging messages or debugging output
>* Changes to ‘metadata’ files like Gemfile, .gitignore, build scripts, etc.
>* Moving source files from one directory or package to another

# How to report a bug
> If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email princemauryapm2001@gmail.com instead.

> Any security issues should be submitted directly to princemauryapm2001@gmail.com
> In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:
> * Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
> * Can I disable something for other people?
>
> If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just email us at princemauryapm2001@gmail.com.

### How to file a bug report
When filing an issue make sure you answer all this-
> 1. What version of python are you using?
> 2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
> 3. What did you do?
> 4. What did you expect to see?
> 5. What did you see instead?

# Code review process

> The info.com team( looks at Pull Requests on a regular basis in a weekly triage meeting.
> If the PRs are worthy you can expect feedback after one week your PRs.
